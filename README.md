LeetCode Practice

```
1_TwoSum: Use one-pass Hash table.
2_AddTwoNumbers: Use Linked List, and construct it. 
3_LongestSubstringWIthoutRepeatingCharacters: 
21_MergeTwoSortedLists: Use Linked List. As you traverse the LL iteratively, modify the two LLs by linking into a single list. 
42_TrappingRainWater: Gotta find a formula / method / pattern solve optimally. 2 pointer technique. 
146_LRUCache: Hash table + LL. Typical Linked List for Caching. But, Hash map is used to improve efficiency - O(1) lookup
200_NumberOfIslands: Typical 2D grid search problem. DFS or BFS. Recursion or Iteration.
937_ReorderDataInLogFiles: ... gotta use the sort (thumb down)
