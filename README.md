LeetCode Practice

```
1_TwoSum: Use one-pass Hash table.
```

```
2_AddTwoNumbers: Use Linked List, and construct it. 
```

```
3_LongestSubstringWIthoutRepeatingCharacters: Two pointer technique. L and R. Use Set because "non-repetitive characters, meaning unique" characters. You can only insert an element into set if it's unique. Slide through the given string with L and R ptrs, and insert into set if s[right] is unique. Else, erase. Keep updating the set size as the answer. 
```

```
21_MergeTwoSortedLists: Use Linked List. As you traverse the LL iteratively, modify the two LLs by linking into a single list. 
```

```
42_TrappingRainWater: Gotta find a formula / method / pattern solve optimally. 2 pointer technique. 
``` 

``` 
146_LRUCache: Hash table + LL. Typical Linked List for Caching. But, Hash map is used to improve efficiency - O(1) lookup
```

``` 
200_NumberOfIslands: Typical 2D grid search problem. DFS or BFS. Recursion or Iteration.
```

```
937_ReorderDataInLogFiles: ... gotta use the sort (thumb down) 
```
